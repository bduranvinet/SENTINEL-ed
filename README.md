# SENTINEL
<u>**S**</u>mart Environmental Nucleic-acid Tracking using Inference from Neural-networks for Early-warning Localization - Educational repository

In particular, SENTINEL is an integrated tool for CRISPR-based environmental biosurveillance. SENTINEL currently leverages ADAPT (Activity-informed Design with All-inclusive Patrolling of Targets) [article here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01213-5). ADAPT is an end-to-end trained artificial intelligence with ~19,000 guide-target pairs, ultimately providing a robust and comprehensive platform for target discovery in the environmental nucleic acid field that can accelerate environmental biosurveillance of emergent biosecurity threats or aid endangered species detection. ADAPT designs are trained to be highly sensitive and specific, with well-established command options that enable high customization for a flexible assay design for the user. ADAPT designs are also scalable and can be locally deployed.

The ultimate objective of SENTINEL is to streamline and accelerate environmental biosurveillance deployments, whether this is from air, soil or water samples. So far, only water has been tested, but air and soil environmental samples are a promising deployment.

Many things in this repository have been taken and adapted from the [Original ADAPT repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/adapt/blob/main/).
